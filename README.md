# Android SDK Integration

## Requirements
  - Android Studio 2.1.2 or higher
  - Min Android SDK 18
  - GooglePlayServices 9.0.2 on device
  - Firebase account
  
## Installing the Library

Before continuing with the installation of the Rover SDK, please make sure you have setup you project and Android app in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).

### JCenter

The easiest way to get Rover into your Android project is to use the [JCenter](https://bintray.com/bintray/jcenter) Maven repository. Just add the following line to the `dependencies` section of your module's `build.gradle` file:

```
compile 'io.rover.library:rover:1.15.5'
```

### Manual Installation

// COMING SOON

## Intializing the SDK

The Rover SDK **MUST** be initialized inside the Application base class `onCreate` method. If your Android application doesn't already have an Application base class, follow [these](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Application.html) instructions to create one.

Add the following snippet to your Application's `onCreate` method:

```java
  RoverConfig config = new RoverConfig.Builder()
          .setApplicationToken("YOUR APPLICATION TOKEN HERE")
          .build();

  Rover.setup(this, config);
```

## Monitoring for Beacons and Geofences

Call the `startMonitoring()` method to begin monitoring for beacons and geofences. You may choose to do this step in any Activity of your choice. 

__IMPORTANT__ 
As of the Marshmallow release, the Android OS requries this to be wrapped in a permission check block. An example of a backwards compatible way to do this is shown below:

```java
public class MainActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
  public void startRoverMonitoring() {
        if (Build.VERSION.SDK_INT >= 23) {
            // Marshmallow+
            if (ContextCompat.checkSelfPermission(getApplicationContext(), Manifest.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION) != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION}, 0);
            } else {
                Rover.startMonitoring();
            }
        } else {
            // Pre-Marshmallow
            Rover.startMonitoring();
        }
  }
  
  @Override
  public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
      if (requestCode == 0) {
          if (grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
              Rover.startMonitoring();
          }
      } else {
          super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
      }
  }
}
```

### Proximity Events

Rover uses the observer pattern to notify the developer of proximity events. The `Rover.addObserver();` method accepts any object implementing one or more of the [RoverObservers](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/RoverObserver.java).

Here's an example of an `Activity` that adds itself as an observer and implements the `MessageDeliveryObserver` interface.

```java
public class MyActivity extends AppCompatActivity implements RoverObserver.MessageDeliveryObserver {
    @Override
    protected void onCreate(bundle savedInstanceState) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
        
        Rover.addObserver(this);
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onDestroy() {
        super.onDestroy();
        
        Rover.removeObserver(this);
    }
    
    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(Message message) {
        Log.i("RoverMessage", "Received message: " + message.getText());
    }
}
```

__IMPORTANT__ Notice that the example removes itself as an observer in the `onDestory` method. This is required in order for the class to properly deallocate itself. Any call to `Rover.addObserver();` _must_ be balanced with a corresponding call to `Rover.removeObserver();`.

### Beacons and Places

// Coming soon 

## Messages

Using the [Rover Messages App](https://app.rover.io/messages/) you can create messages that are delivered to your users when a proximity event is triggered or on a specific date and time. You can attach push notifications to your messages that will be delivered along with your messages. Additionally you can attach content to your messages. The content can be a landing page authored in the [Rover Messages App](https://app.rover.io/messages/) or it can simply link to a website. A message can also trigger functionality within your app through a deep link and can have custom data attached.

### Notifications

**IMPORTANT** Rover reserves the key `_rover` in the notification's data payload. Please ensure all notifications not originating from the Rover Platform do not specifiy this key.

In order to have notification and messages working, Rover needs your FCM server key. Use [this guide](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/wiki/FCM-Setup) to upload your configure Rover with your FCM setup.

If you like fine-grained control over notifications, you must register a [NotificationProvider](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/NotificationProvider.java) during initialization.

```java
  RoverConfig config = new RoverConfig.Builder()
          .setApplicationToken("YOUR APPLICATION TOKEN HERE")
          .setNotificationProvider(new NotificationProvider() {
            ...
          })
          .build();

  Rover.setup(this, config);
```

Check the [Notification Provider](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/NotificationProvider.java) file for more documentation on methods to customize behavior.

### Custom FirebaseMessagingService

If your app is already currently using FCM and implements the `FirebaseMessagingService`, helper methods have been provided to handle Rover notifications. The following example demonstrates these methods

```java
import com.google.firebase.messaging.FirebaseMessagingService;
import com.google.firebase.messaging.RemoteMessage;

import io.rover.Rover;

public class MyFirebaseMessagingService extends FirebaseMessagingService {
    @Override
    public void onMessageReceived(RemoteMessage remoteMessage) {
        if (Rover.isRoverMessage(remoteMessage)) {
            Rover.handleRemoteMessage(remoteMessage);
            return;
        }

        // ...
        // Parse the message as your own
    }
}
```

### Default Back Button Behaviour

If you do not provide a [Notification Provider](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/NotificationProvider.java) to Rover the default back behaviour is to use the parent activity provided in your AndroidManifest file. This is only the case when a message will launch a LandingPage or an Experience. The following example demonstrates that when the back button is pressed after launching an Experience from a notification the MainActivity will run. 

```xml
...
 <activity android:name="io.rover.ExperienceActivity"
    android:parentActivityName=".MainActivity">
    <meta-data
        android:name="android.support.PARENT_ACTIVITY"
        android:value=".MainActivity"/>
</activity>
...
```

### Inbox

Most applications provide means for users to recall messages. You can use the `onMessageReceived(Message message)` callback on a [`MessageDeliveryObserver`](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/RoverObserver.java) to map and add Rover messages to your application's inbox as they are delivered. You may also rely solely on Rover for a simple implementation of such inbox if your application doesn't already have one:

```java
        Rover.reloadInbox(new Rover.OnInboxReloadListener() {
            public void onSuccess(List<Message> messages) {
                // Add to your adapter
            }

            public void onFailure() {}
        });
```

Note that the `reloadInbox` method will only return messages that have been marked to be saved in the Rover Messages app.

See the [MessageFragment](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/example/rover/MessageFragment.java) in the example app for a quick implementation.

#### Deleting messages from the Rover inbox

Rover provides a simple method for deleting messages from the inbox, this can be accomplished with just the message id or the message object itself. Refer to the following snippet on how deletion works

```java
// message -> io.rover.model.Message
Rover.deleteMessage(message, new Rover.OnDeleteMessageListener() {
    @Override
    public void onSuccess() {
       // update your adapter here if presenting messages in a listview
       Log.i("MyApp", "Message has been deleted");
    }

    @Override
    public void onFailure() {
        Log.e("MyApp", "Failed to delete message");
    }
});
```

#### Updating read status of a message

Every Rover message has a flag indicating if the message has been read or not. This can be useful in your application if you wish to display an indicator if the user has interacted with the message before. To accomplish this behaviour Rover provides a `patchMessage` method to update the flag. The following demonstrates how to set a message read status to true

```java
if (!message.isRead()) {
    message.setRead(true);
    Rover.patchMessage(message, new Rover.OnPatchMessageListener() {
        @Override
        public void onSuccess() {
            Log.i("MyApp", "Message has now been read");
        }

        @Override
        public void onFailure() {
            Log.e("MyApp", "Something failed while trying to update the status");
        }
    });
}
```
### Screen Activity

If the message contains a landing page you probably want to present an activity for it. The `getLandingPage()` method of a [`Message`](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/model/Message.java) object is of type [`Screen`](https://github.com/RoverPlatform/rover-android/blob/master/rover/src/main/java/io/rover/model/Screen.java). You can launch the `ScreenActivity` using an Intent which has the `Screen` object in its extras under the key `ScreenActivity.INTENT_EXTRA_SCREEN`.

```java
Intent intent = new Intent(this, ScreenActivity.class);
intent.putExtra(ScreenActivity.INTENT_EXTRA_SCREEN, message.getLandingPage());
startActivity(intent);
```


## Customer Identity

By default the Rover platform will assign a unique identifier to each customer who installs your application. However you may choose to assign your own identifiers. This is particularly useful for mapping data from the Rover Analytics app or if a customer is using your application on multiple platforms. To accomodate this Rover saves customer info to device storage so that it persists across sessions. The following snippet demonstrates assigning your own customer identifier:

```java
Rover.identify(new Traits().putIdentifier("hello123"));
```

In addition to identifiers, you may provide other user attributes for more personlized and segmented messaging via the Rover Messages app.

```java
Rover.identify(new Traits()
        .putAge(44)
        .putEmail("hello@example.com")
        .addTags("a", "b", "c")
        .putPhoneNumber("555-555-5555"));
```

Traits are persisted to and restored from disk. This insures once traits have been set they stay set until changed. However if your app has a login logout feature you will want to make sure to clear all the previous traits that have been stored. To do this simply call 
```java 
Rover.clearCustomer() 
```
