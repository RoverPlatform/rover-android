/**
 * This repository syncs and stores the Push Notifications.
 *
 * A per-device list of received push notifications is kept on the Rover Cloud API (although note
 * this is device-bound, and not bound to any sort of per-user account).  We just use SharedPreferences
 * to store a JSON-encoded blob of all of the current notifications.  This is sufficient because we
 * never anticipate storing more than 100.
 *
 * The arrangement is rather CQRS-like; the notifications list coming from the cloud API is
 * read-only, any items in it can only be marked as read or deleted (the only possible mutations)
 * not through the GraphQL API but instead only by asynchronously emitted events that may be applied
 * any arbitrary amount of time in the future.  This Repository is responsible for maintaining its
 * own state for read and deleted.
